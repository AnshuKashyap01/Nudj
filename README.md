  Your campus, your events – all in one place.

## Project Overview

Tired of missing college events because that one email got buried under 347 unread ones? Or because the WhatsApp group has turned into a meme hub?  
**Nudj** is here to fix that 🎯

We're building an Android app where:
-  Hosts can **list events**, 
-  Students can **RSVP, get tickets**, and 
-  Everyone stays **in the loop** without chaos.

No more last-minute “Oh crap, that was today?!” moments.

---

## Features

### For Hosts
- Login with a valid email (no spams here 👀)
- Create and manage events.
- Add all event details – venue, date-time, description, contact info, FAQs, etc.
- Target specific batches or disciplines.
- Send updates to your followers instantly.

### 🧑‍🎓 For Users
- Follow your favorite event hosts.
- Get notified whenever they post a new event.
- RSVP to events and get a neat little ticket (yes, we might charge you for sports stuff 🏏💸).
- View everything in a clean calendar interface.
- Drop feedback or get notified about last-minute announcements.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

-  **Language**: Kotlin  
-  **UI**: Jetpack Compose  
-  **Backend**: Firebase  

---

## Development Flow

We're keeping things beginner-friendly & organized:

### Phase 1: 
- Only UI issues.  
- Use Jetpack Compose to build components and preview using `@Preview`.

### Phase 2:
- Dive into architecture:  
  - Mock Repositories  
  - ViewModels  
  - Dependency Injection  
  - Compose Navigation  
  - State Management  

### Phase 3:
- Firebase Workshop 🔥 (Get ready!)
- Backend issues with full data flow.

We promise — you'll learn a LOT.
